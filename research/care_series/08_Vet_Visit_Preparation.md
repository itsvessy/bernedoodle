# Vet Visit Preparation

> [!summary]
> Better records produce better clinical decisions. Bring concise logs, targeted questions, and staged priorities.

> [!warning]
> If red-flag symptoms are active, seek immediate care rather than waiting for a planned visit.

## Pre-Visit Data Capture
| Data Type | What To Bring |
|---|---|
| Symptom log | Onset, frequency, duration, severity trend |
| Diet log | Brand/formula, daily amount, treats, transitions |
| Medication list | All meds, preventives, supplements, dates |
| Media | Video of gait, breathing, coughing, behavior episodes |

## Question Sets by Life Stage
- Puppy: vaccine timing, growth rate, socialization limits.
- Adolescent: behavior shifts, activity progression, reproductive planning discussion.
- Adult: weight trends, dental schedule, parasite strategy.
- Senior: mobility pain signs, cognitive shifts, monitoring intervals.

## Post-Visit Action Log
- Capture diagnosis considerations, tests ordered, treatment changes, and follow-up date.
- Convert care plan into dated household tasks.
