# Early Stage Development (0-6 months)

> [!summary]
> Focus on safe socialization, routine building, growth monitoring, and preventive veterinary care.

> [!warning]
> Do not over-exercise large-breed puppies. If limping, persistent diarrhea, breathing difficulty, or fainting appears, seek veterinary care promptly.

## Milestones and Daily Priorities
| Domain | Owner Priority | Frequency |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep and recovery | Provide structured quiet periods and crate rest | Daily |
| House training | Frequent bathroom breaks and reward timing | Daily |
| Socialization | Controlled exposure to people, sounds, surfaces | Daily/weekly |
| Growth tracking | Weekly weight and body condition check | Weekly |

## Feeding Cadence and Growth Monitoring
- Use an age-appropriate complete puppy diet and monitor body condition, not just body weight.
- Split food into multiple meals each day in early puppyhood.
- Avoid abrupt food changes.

## Exercise Limits
- Prioritize short, low-impact sessions and enrichment over sustained high-impact running.
- Increase activity gradually as joints and coordination mature.

## Early Warning Signs
- Poor growth, persistent vomiting, prolonged diarrhea, collapse episodes, or unusual breathing effort require veterinary evaluation.
