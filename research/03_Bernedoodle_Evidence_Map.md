# Bernedoodle Evidence Map

> [!summary]
> Current indexed Bernedoodle-specific peer-reviewed evidence is sparse in this run.

## Included Bernedoodle Studies

| Record ID | Source | Year | Relevance Label | Key Evidence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| SRC-PMID-40187143 | [[sources/SRC-PMID-40187143]] | 2025 | direct_literal | Abstract explicitly lists Bernedoodle subgroup (`2/30`). |

## Synthesis
- The included study addresses congenital cardiac disease context in Standard Poodle crossbreeds and includes Bernedoodles as a small subgroup.
- No Bernedoodle-primary longitudinal development cohort was identified in this run.

## Evidence Quality Snapshot

> [!warning]
> External validity is limited by small Bernedoodle subgroup size and retrospective multicenter design.
