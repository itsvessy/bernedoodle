# Senior Care (7+ years)

> [!summary]
> Priorities in senior years are comfort, mobility, cognitive support, and earlier escalation of subtle health changes.

> [!warning]
> Rapid decline in appetite, breathing changes, collapse, persistent pain signs, or confusion episodes need prompt veterinary assessment.

## Senior Monitoring Framework
| Domain | What To Track | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| Appetite/hydration | Intake changes and GI tolerance | Daily |
| Mobility | Stiffness, stairs, rise/lie transitions | Daily |
| Cognition/behavior | Sleep-wake shifts, disorientation, anxiety | Daily |
| Oral comfort | Chewing changes, oral pain signs | Weekly |

## Nutrition and Activity Adjustments
- Recalculate portions to preserve lean body condition.
- Shift toward joint-friendly activity with frequent shorter sessions.

## Escalation Rules
- Treat new symptoms earlier rather than waiting for persistence.
- Bring objective logs (dates, duration, videos) to visits.
