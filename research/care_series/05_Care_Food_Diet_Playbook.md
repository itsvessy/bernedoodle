# Care, Food, and Diet Playbook

> [!summary]
> Use a body-condition-first feeding workflow, gradual transitions, and written tracking to reduce nutrition-related problems.

> [!warning]
> Persistent vomiting, severe diarrhea, refusal to eat, rapid weight change, or suspected food reaction should be evaluated by a veterinarian.

## Portioning Workflow
| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Start with label-based daily amount for life stage. |
| 2 | Split into planned meals by age and tolerance. |
| 3 | Track body condition weekly. |
| 4 | Adjust total daily amount in small increments. |

## Food Transition Protocol
- Transition over multiple days rather than abrupt switches.
- Pause or slow transition if GI signs appear.

## Treat Budgeting
- Keep treats and extras inside a fixed daily calorie budget.
- Use lower-calorie reinforcers during heavy training periods.

## Hydration and Feeding Context
- Keep fresh water available at all times.
- Align meal timing with exercise and rest routines.
