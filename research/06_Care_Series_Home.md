# Bernedoodle Care Series Home

> [!summary]
> This series provides stage-based Bernedoodle care guidance for owners. Bernedoodle-specific evidence is used where available; otherwise general canine guideline fallback is clearly labeled.

> [!warning]

## How To Use This Series
1. Start with your dog's life stage note.
2. Use the diet and illness playbooks for daily decisions.
3. Use appendices for trackers and checklists.
4. Review evidence labels before acting on a recommendation.
