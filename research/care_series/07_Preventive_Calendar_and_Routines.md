# Preventive Calendar and Routines

> [!summary]
> A recurring preventive schedule reduces avoidable disease burden and keeps records decision-ready.

> [!warning]
> Calendar templates are not a substitute for your veterinarian's individualized protocol.

## Routine Cadence
| Interval | Focus Areas |
|---|---|
| Daily | Feeding consistency, hydration, oral-home care, behavior checks |
| Weekly | Weight/body condition, skin/coat/paw checks, activity tolerance |
| Monthly | Preventive medication confirmations, tracker updates |
| Quarterly | Lifestyle risk review (travel, exposure, boarding) |
| Annual | Full veterinary preventive exam and plan reset |

## Calendar Build Steps
1. Start from veterinary guidance and current products.
2. Add reminder dates with a 7-day pre-alert.
3. Log completion and reactions.
4. Review missed items monthly.
