# Evidence Confidence and Gaps

> [!summary]
> Most practical recommendations in this series are general canine guideline fallback because direct Bernedoodle evidence is currently sparse.

> [!warning]
> Do not interpret low-confidence or gap-labeled items as personalized medical direction.

## Confidence Matrix
| Evidence Type | Current Availability | Typical Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Bernedoodle-specific evidence | Very limited | Low |
| General canine guideline fallback | Broad | Moderate to High |
| Evidence gap / owner-vet decision | Common in breed-specific topics | Gap |

## What Is Bernedoodle-Specific Right Now
- A small Bernedoodle subgroup appears in a 2025 retrospective crossbreed cardiology cohort.
- No robust Bernedoodle longitudinal cohort is currently captured in this vault.

## Priority Research Updates
1. Larger Bernedoodle cohorts by life stage.
2. Breed-specific prevalence and outcomes for common disease categories.
3. Reproducible updates when blocked indexes become accessible.
