# Adolescent Development (6-18 months)

> [!summary]
> Adolescence is a consistency phase: behavior can regress, appetite may fluctuate, and activity needs are high.

> [!warning]
> Sudden exercise intolerance, fainting, or persistent coughing should be escalated quickly to a veterinarian.

## Behavior and Training Priorities
| Area | Practical Approach | Goal |
|---|---|---|
| Recall and impulse control | Short daily repetitions in higher-distraction settings | Reliability |
| Leash behavior | Reward calm pace and check-ins | Safe handling |
| Settling skills | Planned downtime after exercise | Prevent over-arousal |

## Growth and Body Condition
- Keep routine weight and body condition checks.
- Adjust portions based on condition score trends, not appetite alone.

## Activity Progression
- Build duration and intensity gradually.
- Preserve rest days and avoid rapid loading changes.

## Reproductive Decision Prompts
- Discuss timing of spay/neuter and individual risk profile with your veterinarian.
- Document goals, expected lifestyle, and behavior concerns before that conversation.
