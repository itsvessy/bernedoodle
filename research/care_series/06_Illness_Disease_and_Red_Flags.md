# Illness, Disease, and Red Flags

> [!summary]
> Use this triage framework to decide between emergency care, same-day vet care, or monitored follow-up.

> [!warning]
> Emergency signs include collapse, breathing distress, persistent unproductive retching, pale gums, uncontrolled bleeding, or seizures.

## Triage Framework
| Tier | Examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| ER now | Collapse, severe breathing effort, repeated nonproductive retching, severe trauma | Go to emergency veterinary hospital immediately |
| Same-day vet | Persistent vomiting/diarrhea, fever signs, new lameness, eye pain | Call primary vet and request same-day assessment |
| Monitor + schedule | Mild transient appetite drop, brief soft stool without red flags | Monitor closely and schedule if not resolved quickly |

## Disease Category Monitoring
| Category | What Owners Should Watch |
|---|---|
| Cardiorespiratory | Coughing, fatigue, exercise intolerance, faint episodes |
| GI and nutrition | Vomiting, diarrhea, appetite shifts, weight loss |
| Musculoskeletal | Limping, reduced jump/stair tolerance, pain signs |
| Oral and dental | Bad breath, chewing changes, visible oral discomfort |

## Communication Checklist for Vet Calls
- Onset date/time and symptom timeline.
- Any trigger (food change, exercise, environment).
- Medications/supplements given.
- Video/photo evidence when possible.
