# Evidence Gaps

> [!warning]
> Bernedoodle-specific peer-reviewed evidence remains limited and currently insufficient for robust condition-by-condition risk estimates.

## Major Gaps
1. Longitudinal Bernedoodle development cohorts.
2. Bernedoodle-specific prevalence data for orthopedic, endocrine, oncologic, and behavioral outcomes.
3. Genotype-phenotype studies specific to Bernedoodle lineages.
4. Breeder-practice and early-life environment effects with controlled outcomes.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Expand indexing access (CAB Abstracts, Scopus/Web of Science) to move `coverage_status` toward `complete`.
- Add full-text concept-equivalent screening for Bernese x Poodle cohorts.
- Build structured extraction template for future updates.
